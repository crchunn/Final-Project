              KNN or K Nearest Neighbors refers to a algorithm used for classification. It helps with outlier sensitivity, the ability to classify non-linear data,
              and has high accuracy. A negative of KNN is that it requires a lot of memory. When choosing a K value for KNN, it is good to loop through a range of k and calculate the score.
              A k value should be chosen where the score starts to stabilize. I chose a k range of 40 in order for me to see the scores stabilize.

                  This graph is looking at year vs. danceability from 2010-2020 using regression. From this graph, we can see that danceability stayed relatively uniform from 2010-2016 before increasing in popularity from 2017-2020. 
                  As time has gone on, songs have become more danceable.

                      This graph is looking at year vs. energy from 2010-2020 using regression. Based on this graph, we can see that energy peaked in 2010. Energy 
                      throughout the time being measured stayed around 0.6. Songs have had less energy as time has gone on based on the graph.

                      This graph is looking at year vs. popularity from 2010-2020 using regression. From this graph, we can view the changes in popularity over time.
                      The popularity continued to increase from 2010-2019. A reason for this increase in popularity may be in part to more an increased number of users on Spotify. 
                      There is a dip in popularity in 2020 likely due to covid as well as the Kaggle dataset being published early this year.
