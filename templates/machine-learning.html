              This KNN plot is measuring explicit (explicit or not) with a range of 40. We can see that the data starts to stabilize as we hit 23 and stabilizes at 33 which is the k-value I used for the calculations.
              Based on a k-value of 33, our accuracy was 86%.

              KNN or K Nearest Neighbors refers to a algorithm used for classification. It helps with outlier sensitivity, the ability to classify non-linear data,
              and has high accuracy. A negative of KNN is that it requires a lot of memory. When choosing a K value for KNN, it is good to loop through a range of k and calculate the score.
              A k-value should be chosen where the score starts to stabilize. I chose a k range of 40 in order for me to see the scores stabilize.

              With this residual plot on liveness, we are making predictions based on a fitted model. We are plotting the differences between the model predicted values and actual y values against the model predicted values using scaled data. 
              After completing our residual plot, we calculated our r-squared value, which tell us how much of the variance can be explained by the data. Our regular model gave us an r-squared value of 0.48.
              We also used the Lasso Model, Ridge Model, and ElasticNet model to calculate our r-squared values and our r-squared values were -0.26 (Lasso), 0.32(Ridge), and -0.27(ElasticNet).
              With this residual plot, the first Model gave us the highest r-squared value. As a result of having negative r-squared values, our fit is worse than using a horizontal line if we used the Lasso or ElasticNet models for our calculations.

                  As time has gone on, songs have become more danceable.

                      throughout the time being measured stayed around 0.6. Songs have had less energy as time has gone on based on the graph.

                      This graph is looking at year vs. popularity from 2010-2020 using regression. From this graph, we can view the changes in popularity over time.
                      The popularity continued to increase from 2010-2019. A reason for this increase in popularity may be in part to more an increased number of users on Spotify. 
                      There is a dip in popularity in 2020 likely due to covid as well as the Kaggle dataset being published early this year.
