# Hurricane-Predictions
2020 has been one of the worst years for hurricanes since 2005. Creating a predictive model to indicate what areas in the Atlantic may be more severely affected can help those areas prepare for the upcoming season. 
We will be using the National Hurricane Center (NHC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) datasets for hurricanes that starts in 1958 to provide background for the size, damage and path. We will use this information to predict the final months of the hurricane season for 2020 and as a base to predict for 2021.
