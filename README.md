## Our Resources and Tools

### Spotipy
Spotipy is a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API, which can be found at <https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/>. With Spotipy you get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform. Using an import of spotipy and from spotipy.oauth2 we were then able to import SpotifyClientCredentials to access their seemingly limitless music data.

### Tableau
Tableau is a visual analytics platform transforming the way we use data to solve problemsâ€”empowering people and organizations to make the most of their data. For more information, please check out why many folks use Tableau at this link: <https://www.tableau.com/why-tableau/what-is-tableau>. 

### Heroku
Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go.[1][2] For this reason, Heroku is said to be a polyglot platform as it has features for a developer to build, run and scale applications in a similar manner across most languages. Heroku was acquired by Salesforce.com in 2010 for $212 million.

Our group utilized Heroku's free deployment to deploy our webpage. For more information on Heroku, check out their website or read up on <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroku>.


### Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through expertise. [1]It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine Learning Algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as training data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. [1]For more information on machine learning, you can go to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>.

### Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy>. SciPy at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciPy> makes use of Matplotlib. With Matplotlib, static, animated, and interactive visualizations can be created in Python. To learn more about matplotlib, check out <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib>.

### Pandas
Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. The name is derived from the term panel data, an econometrics for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals. [2]Its name is a play on the phrase Python data analysis itself. [4]To learn more about Pandas, check out <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)>.

### Scikit-learn
Scikit (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.[3] It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, and k-means, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
